Nextcloud app to enhance files sharing usage. Easy share, multi-use.

Now you can share your files by path format like below:

`https://youre-domain/nextcloud/apps/sharingpath/username/shared-file-stored-path`

In this way, you can use your nextcloud as CDN origin storage 🌩.

⚠️ **Attention** *Potential security risk: links could be guessed and the files in shared directories can be accessed.*


## Installation

- Install from [Nextcloud App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/sharingpath), navigate in your Nextcloud instance to the `Apps`, in the category `Files` or `Tools` find `Sharing Path` and enable it.

- Install by yourself, download this and put to your Nextcloud instance install path `/your-nextcloud-install-path/apps/`.


## Usage

Just share your files or directories(add a share link without `Hide download` or `Password protect` and not expired if expiration date has set), then you can get the url by click `Copy Sharing Path` from more icon `···` dropdown actions menu or right click menu. 

There are some settings in `Settings` > `Sharing`(Administration & Personal) > `Sharing Path` you may need take a look.
